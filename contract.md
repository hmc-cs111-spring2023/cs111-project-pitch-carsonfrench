## Goals

_At a high level, what do you most want to get out of this project, and why?_

I am excited to get experience working in a studio environment. It will be great to get practice doing both the design and development of the language and thinking in the perspective of a domain expert. 

## Concepts / skills

_What concepts and / or skills from class would you like to work on, as part of your
project? Are there any concepts / skills that we haven't covered in class that you would
like to work on, as part of your project (for example, other things related to DSLs that
you have come across, or topics from other classes)? Why are you interested in working on
these things?_

I am excited to continue working on syntax design. That is something I have enjoyed from earlier in the class. I also hope to learn more about storage and filing systems since I will need to find a way to store the data. 

## Time management plan

_How do you plan to set aside time outside of class, to work on the project? Are there
intermediate milestones that you can create, to help you make consistent progress?_

I think the best way to keep myself on track is with milestones. For the first week my goal is to completely map out my ideal syntax for the design. For the second and third weeks I will focus on data entry and storage, and for the rest of my time I will focus on graph generation. I will decide how much time I should spend on the project outside of class based on how caught up I am on these milestones. 

## Teamwork plan

_If you plan to work with someone else on the project, what is your plan for
collaborating? What part(s) do you think you might do together? What part(s) are you
considering doing separately? How will you hold one another accountable to make regular
progress?_

## Critique plan

_What will you do to make sure that you can give consistent and actionable feedback to
other people in the class?_

In order to give helpful crituques to my classmates. I want to prentend what it would be like to be an expert in their domain. As a computer science student, my understanding to the language might be different than someone who is not used to programming, so I want to make sure I don't assume any knowledge of programming outside of the domain. I also want to spend time interacting with the language and use it to do some of the tasks it was intended for. 

## Success

_At the end of the semester, what would you be proud to show or tell someone about your
project?_

I will consider the project a success if it is something that I would actually use and find helpful. It would be even better if it is easy enough for others to understand and use it as well. 

## Assessment

_Looking over your responses to the previous questions, what would you consider to be an
"A-" for your project? What would you consider to be an "A"?_

An A- would be a language that works but is pretty minimum. An A would be a language that works and is easy to understand and use.
