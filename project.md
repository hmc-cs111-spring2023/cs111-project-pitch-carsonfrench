# Project proposal

## The user and a language

This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.

My idea is a language that can be used to track calories over time and quickly generate custom graphs using the data. This project would serve people who are hoping to lose, gain, or maintain weight or people who are just interested in their calorie intake. A language would be helpful for tracking calories because it could quickly genrate custom graphs for a variety of calorie statistics. 

### What's the need?

_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help
them?_

There are already counless calorie tracking apps available that people can use to track various health statistics such as calorie intake from meals, calories burnt from workouts, and weight. These apps are helpful, but they are not ideal mainly because the graphs are usually locked behind a paywall and/or not very customizable. Furthermore, these apps can track the personal data of their users which can possibly be hacked or sold. My language will hopefully make the calorie and weight graphs simpler to generate and more customizable so users can view the trends that are important to them rather than just some generic graphs they might not care about. The language would also hopefully make users feel more comfortable since their personal data is less vulnerable. 

### Why a language?

_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

There are many 

### Why you?

_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

### Domain

_Describe the project's domain in five words._

### Interface (syntax)

_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_

### Operation (semantics)

_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

### Expressiveness

_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

### Related work

_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

## The Project

This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.

### Suitability

_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

### Scope

_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

### Benefits and drawbacks

_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea
project?_
